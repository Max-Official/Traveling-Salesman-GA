# Traveling-Salesman-GA
This is an attempt to practice coding in Python, and provide a working alternative to the Traveling Salesman problem using Genetic Algorithms (crossover and mutation).

GA_TS.py contains the main code to process data from TS_Distances_Between_Cities.csv. Crossover and mutation functions are stored separately in ga_crossover.py and ga_mutation.py.
